# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I'm proud of how resourceful I was with google! I knew what my goal was and I was able to use tech lingo to articulate what I wanted well enough to get answers pretty fast.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

The ability to run complex code multiple times without having to re-write it every time we need it, therefore making the code "cleaner". This would be useful when working on projects with other people who need to read our code.
